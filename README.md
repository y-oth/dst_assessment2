This project implements and compares a Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN) and a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) for the classification of MRI data. The primary goal is to determine which model architecture serves as a more effective classifier for this specific neuroimaging modality.
