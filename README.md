This project is equally split between the five project partners

## Reading order and requirements

All report content is in the directory:

* report/

  The report takes the following structure:
* 01 - Data.ipynb


 With HTML output of the Rmd content included for convenience.
  ### Requirements:

Requirements for the Rmd files are given within each script, or can be installed in advance using:
```{sh}
Rscript R_requirements.R
```
Requirements for the Python code is given in `requirements.txt`; to install , in a virtual enviroment run:

```{sh}

# Description
This project implements and compares a GCN and a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) for the classification of MRI data. The primary goal is to determine which model architecture serves as a more effective classifier for this specific neuroimaging modality.
