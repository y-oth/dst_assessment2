        "The Vanilla Gradient, first introduced by Simonyan et al. (2014), is the first and simplest gradient based interpretation method we are exploring. It's core concept is that if a small change to pixel $(i,j)$ has a large impact on the model's confidence in a class, that pixel is of high importance. In this project, we are using saliency maps to visualise pixel importance: the brighter the pixel, the more important it was in the CNN's classification decision.\n",
